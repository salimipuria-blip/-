# Security
- Keys live only in Vercel environment variables; the client never sees them. `/api/health` reports provider names, never keys.
- `ENGINE_TOKEN` is compared in constant time. On Vercel, a missing/short token makes every API return 503.
- The console keeps the token in the input field only; it is not written to localStorage.
- Skill files are untrusted data: hashed before use, size-capped (64 KB), path-traversal and symlink checked, never executed. In prompts they are wrapped in `<skill>` tags with a system rule that they cannot grant tools or override rules.
- Free-only policy: OpenRouter models must end in `:free`; any 429/402/5xx moves to the next free provider, then stops with `PROVIDERS_EXHAUSTED`. No paid fallback exists in code.
- Known gap: bearer token pasted in the UI is a migration step; replace with an HttpOnly cookie session.
